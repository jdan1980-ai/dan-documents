## Phase 1 batch — week of May 13–19

These are the first 3 hybrid-format videos for the gradual transition (Phase 1 = 1 of 4 / week, but we're running 3 as a test batch). Each script file under `scripts/` has the full 11-item `SW:` package: Suno A + Suno B + NanoBanana 16:9 + NanoBanana 9:16 + ffmpeg command + Title + Description + Tags + Hashtags + Pinned comment + A/B variant.

| Date | Slug | Aesthetic-lean | Why |
|------|------|----------------|-----|
| TBD | `tokyo-apartment-rain-1h` | Tokyo apartment + heavy rain on glass + neon city + tea + bonsai. **Power Hour format (1H 04min, 24 Suno tracks, no loop)** | Catches "1 hour focus music" + "power hour" search demand. Lower production overhead than 2H. |
| TBD | `bonsai-desk-night-2h` | Tokyo apartment + open MacBook (warm screen glow) + bonsai + neon city | Most "coding/programming" hook, laptop is the hero |
| TBD | `lantern-glow-study-3h` | Tokyo apartment + paper andon lantern (warm vs neon contrast) + closed laptop + book | Most "scholarly/study" hook, lantern is the hero, longest at 3H |

Mix the 3 with current иероглиф / Hz format videos so the channel doesn't shift too fast.

## Workflow per video

1. Trigger `SW: [theme]` or `SWS: [theme]` in chat — get the 11-item package
2. Generate music in Suno (Prompts A + B)
3. Generate image in NanoBanana (16:9 + 9:16)
4. Generate video loop in Flow / Kling
5. Edit + master in CapCut + ffmpeg
6. Generate thumbnail via `THUMB: [theme]` → Canva
7. Schedule upload in YouTube Studio
8. After publish: update `published-videos.md` with views at 48h / 7d / 30d
